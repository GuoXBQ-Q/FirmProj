I will provide you with a list containing a series of filenames and their path information. Your task is to analyze the file list and identify IoT firmware files. Please strictly follow the judgment logic below:

<Input Content>
[file_list]
</Input Content>

Please apply the rules in the following order:
1. Exclusion criteria filter: Exclude files when the path or filename contains keywords related to application settings, such as: "language", "voice", "skin", "theme", "build", "sdk".

2. Path detection: Mark as firmware if the file path contains any of the following directories:
   ["firmware", "fw", "ota"]

3. Filename keyword detection: Mark as firmware if the filename contains keywords related to firmware/firmware update or upgrade, such as: "ota", "dfu", "firmware", "fw", "boot", "update", "upgrade".

4. Naming format detection: Mark as firmware if the filename contains a combination of device model and firmware version, such as: "AX3600_v2.1.8.bin", "nx_a60f6-m-bmt_mtk-1611_031_v4.bin", "ELDv2-315.bin".

Output requirements:
- The output should be in list format.
- Each list item should include the full file path.
- If no files meet the conditions, output an empty list [].
- Even if a file meets multiple conditions, list it only once.


Examples:
- example input 1:
["assets/o0oooOO0ooOo.dat",
"assets/dial/ycy/circle_240x240.zip",
"assets/FwData.bin",
"assets/smartledrx/SSMLm_w9_jing_xun_4.0-SmartLEDRx_2.2.6-3-g0e69967-b_DELIVERY_SmartLEDRx_2.2.bin",
"assets/uiid225.09e2d566038f829116dc36baad09f7a2.android.zip",
"assets/otav1/mesh-ota-220000.bin",
"assets/tencentmap/mapsdk_vector/escalator.dat",
"assets/qbar/srnet.bin"]
- example output 1:
["assets/FwData.bin","assets/otav1/mesh-ota-220000.bin","assets/smartledrx/SSMLm_w9_jing_xun_4.0-SmartLEDRx_2.2.6-3-g0e69967-b_DELIVERY_SmartLEDRx_2.2.bin"]

- example input 2:
["assets/dbupdate2/1.10.0.198/koscko.bin","assets/dbupdate2/1.10.0.198/lang_de.dat","assets/models/sf2378.zip","assets/ASAP_STYLE.dat"]
- example output 2:
